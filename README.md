# Console Finances

## Overview

This is JavaScript code for analyzing the financial records of a company, containing month/year and the amount.

It calculates each of the following:

- The total number of months included in the dataset.

- The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

- The average of the **changes** in Profit/Losses over the entire period:
  - Calculated by finding the change in profits from month to month and then the average of that
- The greates increase in profit (date and amount) over the entire period

- The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

## Console Output

The final code prints the analysis to browser console, as below:

```text

## My Process

- Pseudocode written first and is also visible in the comments sections throughout my code
- Code brokend down in smaller sections initially and then joined together
- Console.log used throughout to test the output
- Searate for loops used for average changes, max profit and max loss but refactored when completed

## Built with...

- JavaScript

## What I learned

- For loop iteration through nested array
- Selection of the appropriate array elements and performing neccessary operations
- separate for loops used initially for total average change, max profit and max loss but refactored when completed
