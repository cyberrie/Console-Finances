It calculates each of the following:

- The total number of months included in the dataset.

- The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

- The average of the **changes** in Profit/Losses over the entire period:
  - Calculated by finding the change in profits from month to month and then the average of that
- The greates increase in profit (date and amount) over the entire period

- The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
